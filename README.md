## About the Project

**Summary**: BlocTickets is a blockchain-based platform where users can create events and buy NFT tickets, tackling ticket scalping and enhancing trust. Built on Celo to leverage its fast, secure, and eco-friendly blockchain infrastructure, BlocTickets provides a seamless mobile-first experience with low transaction fees, making it accessible for users around the world. 

**Problem Statement**: The traditional event ticketing industry faces numerous challenges, including ticket scalping, fraud, and lack of transparency. These issues undermine trust and can result in significant financial losses for both event organizers and attendees. Additionally, there is often no reliable way to verify the authenticity of an event, leaving buyers unsure of the legitimacy of the events they plan to attend.

**Solution**: BlocTickets offers a blockchain-based platform where users can create events and purchase tickets that are issued as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This innovative approach ensures that each ticket is unique, verifiable, and secure, addressing the problems of ticket scalping and fraud. By recording transactions on the blockchain, BlocTickets provides a transparent and immutable record of ticket ownership and event details. Furthermore, the planned incorporation of Bloc DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) will add a layer of community-driven verification, confirming the existence and authenticity of events and enhancing buyer confidence.

### Objectives
- **Eliminate Ticket Scalping and Fraud**: Implement blockchain technology to issue tickets as NFTs, ensuring their authenticity and preventing duplication or counterfeit tickets.
- **Enhance Trust and Transparency**: Provide a transparent platform where all transactions and ticket ownership are recorded on the blockchain, fostering trust among users.
- **Simplify Event Creation and Management**: Offer a user-friendly interface for event organizers to create and manage their events, streamlining the process of selling tickets.
- **Introduce Decentralized Event Verification**: Develop and incorporate Bloc DAO to verify the legitimacy of events, providing additional security for ticket buyers.
- **Promote Community Governance**: Enable community participation in platform governance through the Bloc DAO, ensuring that decisions are made democratically and in the best interest of users.

### Scope
- **Event Creation and Management**: Users can create, manage, and promote their events on the BlocTickets platform. Event organizers will have access to tools for tracking ticket sales and managing attendees.
- **NFT Ticketing System**: All tickets will be issued as NFTs, providing a secure and verifiable method of ticket distribution. This system will prevent ticket scalping and fraud by ensuring each ticket is unique and traceable.
- **Blockchain-Based Transactions**: All ticket sales and transfers will be recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability of all transactions.
- **Bloc DAO Integration**: The platform will introduce Bloc DAO to facilitate a decentralized verification process for events. Members of the DAO will participate in validating the authenticity of events, providing an added layer of security.
- **Community Governance**: The Bloc DAO will also serve as a governance body, where users can stake tokens and participate in decision-making processes, influencing the platform's development and policies.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The platform will be designed with a focus on usability, ensuring a seamless experience for both event organizers and attendees.

## Project Timeline

BlocTickets was initiated on May 1st with the vision to revolutionize the event ticketing industry. When the hackathon was announced on May 2nd, it became evident that BlocTickets was a perfect fit. The hackathon provided an exciting opportunity to continue building and submit the project, adhering to the rules which require disclosure of the project's inception in relation to the hackathon's announcement.

## Features In Progress

While BlocTickets is operational and allows users to successfully create and pay for events using cUSD, we are actively working on expanding its capabilities. The following features are under development:

### Tickets as NFTs

The core feature of issuing event tickets as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) is currently in progress. This will ensure each ticket's uniqueness and verifiability, providing a robust solution against ticket scalping and fraud.

### Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)

We are also in the process of developing and incorporating the Bloc DAO. This will serve as a decentralized governance layer for the platform, allowing the community to verify event authenticity and participate in decision-making processes.

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to build and improve BlocTickets to serve you better!
